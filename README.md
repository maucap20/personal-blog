# personal-blog

I was not able to get the full functionality of the code. The home page works correctly, although not styled exactly similar to the mock-up, and the submit button works as well, however my code breaks when going to the blog.html page. I have attached 2 screenshots of the page, and the link to my deployed site can be found below.

I ended up going to deep in trying to fix my code and forgot to commit early on when i had the basics down, looks like a hot pile of mess now.
